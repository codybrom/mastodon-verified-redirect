# mastodon-verified-redirect

This is a simple Vercel-ready project to redirect a domain to a destination URL but can still be verified for Mastodon.

To use this template, deploy to Vercel then edit index.html with your destination link and Mastodon profile URL. Test that the Vercel URL is being verified before linking your domain.
